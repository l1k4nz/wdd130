    <h3>Juan David</h3>
    <p>Hello everybody, I'm Juan Condori, I'm from Tacna-Perú, but also I lived in Bolivia-La Paz, Cusco, Lima, Apurimac. I´m very excited for the course, after so long sick I´m returned BYUI online, my dream was to live in Idaho or Utah for study in campus, but some friends teach me that I should learn to be happy in everywhere, with everybody. My major is technology applied, my problem with technology was the addiction to videogames (dota 2), I fixed it making more compromises, new responsibilities.
        This is my singles ward. We Are Tiny.</p>
    <p>This is my new para.</p>
