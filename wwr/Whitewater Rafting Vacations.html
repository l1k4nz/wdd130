 The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages
 in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map
 above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or
 child pages.
 </p>
 <p>
 The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should
 be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the
 global navigation for the site.
 </p>
 <!--
Choose your pages that you will create and put the names inside the two child page 
boxes… Some suggestions are below:
• FAQ
• Blog
• Contact Us
• Rivers We Run
• Schedule/Rates/Dates -->

 <h2>
 Wireframes
 </h2>
 <p>
 Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages. They should show the
 major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative
 locations of each element. In the wireframe below you can see there will
 be 6 sections to our page:
 </p>
 <ol>
 <li>
 At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain
 means an image) and the navigation bar.
 </li>
 <li>
 Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the
 screen.
 </li>
 <li>Next we have some text and an image</li>
 <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
 <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
 <li>
 Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3 social media
 icons.
 </li>
 </ol>
