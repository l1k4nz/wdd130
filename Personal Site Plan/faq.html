      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    </div>
    <br>

    <h3>I've never held a gun before. Is the Basic Handgun Class good for me?</h3>
    Yes. This class is designed for the person who is unfamiliar with guns.

    <br><br>

    <h3>Will I be the only woman in the class?</h3>
    No. Female students account for 40% to 60% of every class.

    <br><br>

    <h3>Do you offer classes for "Women Only"?</h3>
    No. The lessons and techniques we teach apply to everyone for every situation.

    <br><br>

    <h3>Do you provide semi-automatics for the Basic Handgun Class?</h3>
    No, only Smith &amp; Wesson 38 revolvers with a four-inch barrel are provided. After you have completed the
    basic class, we suggest you go to an indoor shooting range that has a selection of 60 or 70 types of handguns so
    you can try as many as you like to find the "perfect" gun for you.

    <br><br>

    <h3>Can I bring my AR-15 pistol to class?</h3>
    No, our handgun classes are geared towards the typical handgun owned by most people. The length of the AR-15
    type pistol does not allow for a safe environment for all students with the drills we teach.

    <br><br>

    <h3>How big are the classes?</h3>
    They usually range from 10 to 40. Classes have a maximum ratio of one instructor for every three students. All
    classes are highly supervised. We have a cadre of 19 Certified Instructors.

    <br><br>

    <h3>What is the minimum age requirement?</h3>
    A parent or guardian is required to take the class along with a child under the age of 18. We ask you, the
    parent, "Do you feel comfortable with the child next to you with a loaded gun?" If you have any doubts, wait a
    couple of years. Children are actually easier to teach than adults, because when we tell a child to do
    something, they do it. Adults ask, "Why?"

    <br><br>

    <h3>Is my B.F.S.C. and/or my H.S.C. Still valid in California?</h3>
    No, the lifetime B.F.S.C. was repealed some time ago. If you have a H.S.C. (Handgun Safety Certificate), it is
    valid to purchase handguns only until it's expiration date . These programs have been replaced by the Firearm
    Safety Certificate (F.S.C.).

    <br><br>

    <h3>I need a F.S.C. to purchase a firearm (handgun/long gun) in California. How do I get it?</h3>
    Our Basic Handgun Class meets the requirements in California to be D.O.J. certified. The F.S.C. program has now
    gone internet based and as such, we can no longer offer this service to you at Burro Canyon (there is no
    internet service available at Burro Canyon). After class, you can walk into any gun store, take a short test,
    pay the state filing fee and receive your F.S.C.

    <br><br>

    <h3>How long is the H.S.C. good for? How long is the F.S.C. good for?</h3>
    The HSC program will expire at the end of 2019. You may use your H.S.C. to purchase handguns only until your
    card's expiration date. The F.S.C. must be renewed every 5 years and is good for handgun and long gun purchases.

    <br><br>

    <h3>How do I dress?</h3>
    You will be at an outdoor range with gravel and dirt walk areas. Wear comfortable flat shoes, shorts or pants,
    short-sleeve or tee shirts. Wear or bring layers as the weather can change from morning to afternoon. No
    camouflage pants or shirts are permitted.

    <br><br>

    <h3>What do I need to bring to the range with me?</h3>
    A hat and sunblock is recommended during warm weather. If you have sunglasses or prescription glasses, bring
    them. If you have ear protection, bring it. If not, we will provide eye and ear protection at no additional
    charge. You should bring a lunch. The lunch break is one hour, and may be eliminated if your class is small and
    finishes sooner than a large class would.

    <br><br>

    <h3>When I know what classes I want to take, what do I do?</h3>
    When you are ready to register for a class, visit our <a href="schedule.html">Class Schedules</a> page and click
    on the "Enroll in Class" link for the class you would like to take. When filling out the form you will be given
    the option to either pay online or mail in your payment. Upon receipt of payment, we will e-mail you confirming
    your attendance, supply details needed for class, and provide directions to the range. Please make sure when
    mailing payment that your deposit/pre-payment arrives to us 3 days prior to your scheduled class.

    <br><br>

    <h3>What happens if I sign up for a class, mail in my deposit, but can't make it?</h3>
    You must contact us 24 hours before the class if you can't make it and we will apply your deposit to a class
    that suits your schedule. If you do not cancel 24 hours prior to class, you are subject to losing your
    deposit/pre-payment. No refunds are given.

    <br><br>

    <h3>What happens if it's raining the day of the class?</h3>
    The ranges are outdoors. Heavy rain may cancel class due to unsafe conditions on the road or the range. Unless
    notified the night before, classes will be held as scheduled.

    <br><br>

    <h3>Do you offer more advanced classes than the basic handgun class, and do you offer classes for different
      types of guns?</h3>
    Please scroll through the section entitled "Class Descriptions" which will give you information on all of the
    classes offered to the general public. Classes cover handgun (revolver and semi-automatic), shotgun and rifle.
    Private instruction is also available, please contact us with your inquiries.

    <br><br>

    <h3>I've been shooting for years. Do I need to start at the Basic Class?</h3>
    Yes. Our insurance carrier insists that everyone start with the basic class. We will fine tune your techniques -
    you may have developed some bad habits watching John Wayne, Clint Eastwood and Mel Gibson. Take heart, the class
    starts with the basic's but quickly gathers speed. In the combat portion of the class, you will be doing rapid
    fire (double taps and triple taps) and multi-target drills.

    <br><br>

    <h3>Can I borrow a handgun for the other classes (Intermediate, Advanced &amp; Scenarios)?</h3>
    No, because you need other equipment in addition to your handgun for these classes. The training is specialized
    to make you and your gun a team. Some people do not want to buy a holster because they think they will never use
    it again. If you are out in the wilderness or a natural disaster occurs, you will be carrying a gun on your hip
    because law enforcement may not be available for an extended period of time.

    <br><br>

    <h3>Do I need to take the Basic Handgun Class before I take the Basic Shotgun or Basic Rifle Class?</h3>
    No. Neither the Basic Shotgun Class nor the Basic Rifle Class have prerequisites.

    <br><br>

    <h3>Can I borrow a shotgun or rifle for those classes?</h3>
    Yes. At no additional charge, shotguns for the basic, advanced and scenarios classes will be provided if needed.
    Rifles will be provided for the basic and advanced classes if needed.

    <br><br>

    <h3>If I register more than one person, or sign up for multiple classes, can I get a discount?</h3>
    No. The range and insurance carrier charge on a per person basis. We do not receive a discount, so we cannot
    pass one on to you.

    <br><br>
