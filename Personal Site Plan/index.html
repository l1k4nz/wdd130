        <h2>Values</h2>
        <p>We believe that the most powerful weapon of a nation is its education. And we believe that ignorance and misinformation is the root
          of all evil. <em>Teamwork:</em>  Understand people to understand the world. We believe that individually you can achieve many things, 
          but in a group you can go even further. We believe that when the spirit of teamwork wins, in reality we all win. Therefore we believe
          in open information. <em>Inclusive:</em> In our university discrimination is prohibited, everyone is encouraged not to use labels, 
          prejudices of any kind to anyone or oneself. We support the different multiple intelligences and adapt our curriculum and specialized 
          teachers for each group of students with different types of learning, recognizing the country's biodiversity and multiculturalism. 
          <em>Creative:</em> On our campus there are no bad ideas, they are all potentially powerful ideas capable of improving the world, and 
          with the proper direction and patience, they will be fulfilled  </p>
