        <h2>Teamwork:</h2>
        <p> Understand people to understand the world. We believe that individually you can achieve many things, but in 
          a group you can go even further. We believe that when the spirit of teamwork wins, in reality we all win. Therefore we
          believe in open information. Inclusive:In our university discrimination is prohibited, everyone is encouraged not to 
          use labels, prejudices of any kind to anyone or oneself. We support the different multiple intelligences and adapt our
          curriculum and specialized teachers for each group of students with different types of learning, recognizing the 
          country's biodiversity and multiculturalism. Creative:On our campus there are no bad ideas, they are all potentially 
          powerful ideas capable of improving the world, and with the proper direction and patience, they will be fulfilled </p>
