    <h2>Basic Handgun Class</h2>

    <p>This practical self-defense handgun course introduces the participant to the Fundamentals of Firearms Safety,
      along with the skills necessary to properly handle a revolver and semi-automatic pistol. You will learn what a
      handgun will do, what it won't do, and why it works the way it works. The hands-on training will start with<b>
        Proper Stance and Grip, Sight Alignment, Sight Picture and Trigger Control.</b></p>

    <p>Class will progress to <b>rapid fire/combat shooting and multi-target drills with life-size paper silhouette
        targets.</b> The student will fire 250 rounds, and receive the same basic training that a police officer
      receives at the Academy, except focused on self-defense.</p>
    <p>The 1.5 hour lecture portion includes the legal aspects of owning, transporting and using a firearm in
      self-defense situations, along with tactics of self-defense. This class is certified by the State of California,
      Department of Justice for the Firearm Safety Certificate (F.S.C.). This certificate is required in order to
      purchase a firearm in California. The F.S.C. program has now gone internet based and as such, we can no longer
      offer this service to you at Burro Canyon (there is no internet service available at Burro Canyon). You can walk
      into any gun store, take a short test, pay the state filing fee and receive your F.S.C.</p>

    <h2>Basic Handgun Class - Two</h2>

    <p>This course is strongly recommended before taking the Intermediate Handgun Class where speed and accuracy is
      important. This is a great class if you have the basics and want to improve your accuracy and confidence to
      shoot well in a pressure situation; or, you haven't been practicing on a regular basis; or you want to practice
      double and triple taps, which are not allowed at most ranges.</p>

    <p>Emphasis is placed on improving the shooter's ability to make rapid multiple shots on both single and multiple
      targets at varying distances. Many of these practical and varied exercises can be practiced at any range, so you
      can add variety and fun to your own practice sessions.</p>

    <h2>Intermediate Handgun Class</h2>

    <p><b>Why take this class?</b> So you can respond to the most common self-defense situations and problems that
      occur at home. This class allows you the opportunity to understand, develop and practice the necessary skills.
      For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What if you awake and are looking down the barrel of a loaded gun? What do you do?</li>
      <li>How close should you be to the target before you shoot?</li>
      <li>What if you are being pursued as you run to get your gun out of a dresser drawer?</li>
      <li>What if your gun jams? What if you have to reload quickly?</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Who should take this class?</b> All gun owners who believe that a gun at home is a valuable tool to have
      when a life-threatening situation arises, or when there is no reasonable expectation of law enforcement for an
      extended period of time. That could be when you are in the wilderness; it could be when you are in your home and
      the neighborhood is devastated by an earthquake, flood, fire, tornado, or hurricane.</p>
    <p><b>What will you learn? </b> You will learn the answers to the above questions along with these shooting
      techniques: rapid reloading, one-arm shooting (left arm and right arm), malfunction drills, half-turns and full
      turns, and close quarter battle (CQB). You will shoot 300 rounds at life-size silhouettes.</p>

    <h2>Advanced Handgun Class</h2>

    <p>You will review the tactics and techniques previously learned, and add new firing positions such as kneeling,
      sitting and prone. You will learn how to <em>think</em> as you fire from cover, <em>think</em> as you fire while
      moving, shoot-move-shoot, fire at moving targets, and you will be <em>challenged</em> with problem solving
      situations, such as firing from left and right barricades. Targets include, but are not limited to, life-size
      silhouettes, falling metal plates, duelling trees, and bowling pins.</p>

    <h2>Situation Tactics Handgun Class</h2>

    <p>This course emphasizes state-of-the-art tactical responses to self-defense situations at home, at work, in your
      automobile, in a hotel, and in other public areas. Taught are tactical principles, offensive and defensive
      plans, environmental awareness and tactical prevention, establishment of safe zones, communication techniques,
      searching techniques and crisis management. You will become aware of how street crimes and terrorist acts are
      committed, so you can hopefully spot and avoid some common crimes. Shooting drills require decision making,
      including shoot/no shoot decisions. The student's mental and mechanical skills are challenged in this class. You
      will have multiple opportunities to practice a variety of tactical responses under the stress of simulated
      encounters.</p>

    <h2>Concealed Drawing Handgun Class</h2>

    <p>Basic drawing from a hip holster will be reviewed and practiced; then the student will be introduced to new
      skills. Emphasis will be placed on the skill to safely draw a gun that is concealed. Students are encouraged to
      bring a variety of outer clothing: light jacket, heavy jacket, sweatshirt and blousy shirt.</p>

    <p>Students who have the desire to compete in matches sanctioned by the International Defensive Pistol Association
      (IDPA) will learn the skills necessary to shoot the concealed drawing courses of fire.</p>
    <p>This class satisfies the CCW (carry concealed weapon) training requirements of all California counties, and
      many local law enforcement agencies within the counties. While this is one of the few recognized private
      firearms training course of its type in California, completion does not guarantee CCW issuance. Many people take
      this course for the experience and training with no thought of applying for a permit.</p>
