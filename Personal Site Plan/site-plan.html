        Imagine combining: Learning by doing, playful imagination, analytical rigor, curiosity, passion and service. Our teachers, highly demanding according to international standards of educational excellence, are committed to teaching with practice. They set the example by working in the university's own facilities in areas related to their teaching subject.
      </p>
      <b> Our Mission and Values
      </b>Mission: Make the best free private university in the world and make education accessible to all, regardless of race, gender, belief, socioeconomic position.We believe that the most powerful weapon of a nation is its education. And we believe that ignorance and misinformation is the root of all evil.
      Teamwork: Understand people to understand the world. We believe that individually you can achieve many things, but in a group you can go even further. We believe that when the spirit of teamwork wins, in reality we all win. Therefore we believe in open information.
      Inclusive:In our university discrimination is prohibited, everyone is encouraged not to use labels, prejudices of any kind to anyone or oneself. We support the different multiple intelligences and adapt our curriculum and specialized teachers for each group of students with different types of learning, recognizing the country's biodiversity and multiculturalism.
      Creative:On our campus there are no bad ideas, they are all potentially powerful ideas capable of improving the world, and with the proper direction and patience, they will be fulfilled

      <h3>Teaching and learning</h3>
      <p>
      Our teaching model:We all learn. We learn from each other. We do not believe in the autonomy and authority of the teacher. The student has the same rights as the teacher and the director. We believe that giving a little authority makes a man act unjustly on another. For this reason, when teaching, evaluating, and at all times, the student as well as the teacher have the same privileges to jointly analyze, check, correct the notes and ways of teaching. We also do questionnaires, daily, weekly and monthly accountability to see the performance of the student, teacher and all members of the University. The hierarchy that we have in the University, will only be used to fulfill roles, rules of coexistence and responsibilities, however these may be questioned by any member of the university campus
      The learning model is focused on research, teamwork in classrooms, laboratories, real work fields with real companies.
      We have workshops, courses, excursions, unpaid and paid internships that include students, teachers and families. We have the latest technology to make the classes even more attractive.
      Teaching centered on people, not on the lesson. We are not focused on just rigidly complying with all the material in the curriculum, but also on teachers setting the example of passion for their subject and awakening that same passion in students. We believe that example is one of the best ways of teaching.
