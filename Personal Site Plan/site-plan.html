        At IU, we revel in a culture of learning by doing. Our students combine analytical rigor with curiosity, playful imagination, and an appetite for solving the toughest problems in the service of society. Across IU, faculty help set the global standard for excellence in their disciplines—they're pioneering scholars who love to teach. Deeply committed to practice, they break down conventional walls between fields in the push for deeper understanding and fresh ideas. In fact, many faculty are active in at least one of IU's interdisciplinary labs, centers, initiatives, and institutes that address critical challenges from clean energy to cancer.
      </p>
      <b> Our Mission and Values
      </b>Mission-Focused:We are committed to our collective mission first and foremost. We align our work, priorities, and strategies with those of the Institute. We steward our collective resources, and leverage our capabilities and capacities for the greatest impact.Collaborative:We support and nourish ideas that work, whatever their source or popularity. We treat one another with respect, directness, and trust. We share credit, generously believing that when the spirit of collaboration trumps individual ego, we all win. Open: We believe in openness, collaboration, and transparency as more powerful, and more fun. We prefer and promote open software and technology, and open sharing of information. People: We support our team. We listen and respond to one another and to others at MIT and beyond. We value diversity, humility, and service to others. We take our work very seriously, but ourselves, not so much. Innovative: We value creativity and initiative, remaining proactive. We strive to be flexible, nimble, and to continually improve. We accept risk and the potential for failure as essential to experimentation and learning. Research-Based:We strive for excellence, pursuing new ideas and basing our plans on the best evidence available. We believe in honest, systematic, and thorough evaluation.

      <h3>Teaching and learning</h3>
      <p>
      Our campus is a workshop for inventing the future and we are all learners, learning from each other as we go. Because we like to make things and we like to have an impact, the courses emphasize design, invention, collaboration and translation of the student experience to reach the world. Through unique experiential learning programs, students can pursue virtually endless co-curricular and extra-curricular projects, here at IU, throughout the Innovation Center, and around the world. Packed with legendary labs, dozens of maker/research spaces, and a glass lab, our campus of idiosyncratically numbered buildings adds up to a prime location to make the most of its potential. We revel in the beauty and creative power of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, and we make a special effort to spark that same passion in students from kindergarten through high school, in school, after school. school and during the summer. Locally, we engage students, teachers, and families with a variety of hands-on offerings, from structured IU field trips to programs designed to encourage kids in their love of technology and science. We also offer a variety of resources for teachers, to help them make science and engineering easy to understand and irresistibly interesting.
