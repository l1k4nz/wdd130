    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      • I work with computers.
      • I am a computer programmer.
      • I make movil Apps.
      • My company writes web and mobile applications for businesses.
      • My company's current goal is to develop web and mobile applications for local food truck companies that serve in Perú.
      • Most food trucks live and thrive through their social media presence. Instead of going to each social media page to find out if your favorite food trucks are 
      serving near you wouldn’t it be nice to have one central hub location to get info on all the food trucks serving near you in one spot.
