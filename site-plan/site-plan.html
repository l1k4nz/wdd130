        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>We are here to provide you with an <strong><em> unforgettable adventure!</em></strong>
        You <em>will</em> have thrills, maybe some spills, and possibly some chills as you go with us to explore a river and see scenery that you won't see from the back seat of a car.</p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>We offer this adventure to families, friends, groups, and individuals. The only prerequisite is that you must be ready to get wet and can safely wear and use a life preserver.</p>

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>Heading Font: Permanent Marker</h4>
        <p>I selected this font because it evokes images of boxes of pictures and keepsakes that I want to tie to the theme of a treasured adventure. It is a comfortable font that everyone has used and it is not intimidating.</p>
        <h4>Paragraph Font: Nunito</h4>
        <p>Nunito has a casual feel to it but it also has a rigid structure. So it looks official without being threatening.</p>
        <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
        <p>The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and
            Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
            Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.</p>
        <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
        <p class="colored">Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and
            experienced rafters. No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, Thrills, Spills and Chills Rafting Company
            can make it happen for you.</p>
